"""Checks every plugin in this repository, and rewrites index.json.

Run before pushing:

    python3 tools/validate.py          # check only
    python3 tools/validate.py --write  # check, then regenerate index.json

The app installs straight from the folders, so nothing here is required for a
plugin to work. What this catches is the class of mistake that only shows up
once someone has already installed the thing: a duplicate id, a manifest that
is not valid JSON, an entry script named in the manifest but missing.
