"""A file on the host, read the way ``open()`` would let you read it.

An archive is read from the end: the central directory is the last thing in it,
and every member is then found by an offset. That is the opposite of how the
first version of this plugin worked — it pulled the whole archive across and
capped itself at 256 MB, so a DVD image in a ZIP was simply out of reach and a
2 GB backup took a 2 GB copy in memory to list.

``host.read`` has always taken an offset. What was missing was something that
looks like a file, so that :mod:`zipfile` can do the seeking for us rather than
the format being parsed by hand. That is all this is: seek and read, answered by
the host, which means it works on an archive sitting on FTP or inside another
plugin's file system exactly as it does on the local disk.
