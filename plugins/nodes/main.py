"""Files that *are* a node graph, drawn as one.

A ComfyUI workflow is a picture saved as JSON. Read as text it is four thousand
lines of coordinates; read as what it is, it is a dozen boxes with the prompt and
the seed written on them and the wires between them. This turns the one into the
other, and the host draws it.

**One plugin, several readers**, which was his answer on 2026-08-15: less to
install, and the document schema stays honest by having more than one user of it.
ComfyUI's native form is the first; n8n, Node-RED, the API export and Godot
scenes follow.
LiteGraph documents need no reader of their own — ComfyUI *is* LiteGraph, and a
class the table has never heard of gets numbered values rather than guessed
labels, which is the honest answer for a graph from some other editor built on
it.

**And the graph inside a picture.** Most ComfyUI workflows never exist as a
`.json` at all: the editor writes the whole document into the PNG it just
generated, and that image is what people keep and send each other. F3 on it
opens the picture — that is what the file is — and Shift+F3 comes here, which
reads the workflow out of the image's text chunks. See `png.py`.

**How it wins the `.json` files that are its own, and only those.** Every one of
these formats is a `.json`, and `.json` belongs to the text viewer — a reader
that took the extension outright would open `package.json` as an empty canvas.
So it claims the extension at a lower priority *and* declares a **probe**: the
host hands it the first pages of the file before it settles the order, and a
file that really is a workflow opens on **F3**. Anything else falls through to
the text viewer exactly as before, and the graph stays one Shift+F3 away.
