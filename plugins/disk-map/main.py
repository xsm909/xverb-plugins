"""Disk map — what is taking up the room, drawn as a ring.

A folder becomes a chart of everything inside it, biggest first, several levels
deep. Press a wedge to walk into it, press it with the right button to put it
on the list to go, and press Clean up to have the application delete the lot —
to the recycle bin, after asking, because a plugin does not get to delete
things on its own.

The scan runs on a thread and pushes what it has found every half second, so a
whole drive fills the ring in front of you instead of arriving all at once
after a minute of nothing.
