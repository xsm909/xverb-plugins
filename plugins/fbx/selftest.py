"""Runs the FBX reader over a folder of files and says what it found.

    python3 selftest.py ~/Games/UE_5.7/Engine/Content/FbxEditorAutomation

This is not a unit test and does not pretend to be one: FBX is a format you
learn by feeding it files somebody else wrote. It is here because this plugin
is being built over several sittings, and the first thing to know each time is
whether the whole corpus still reads.

What it checks, beyond "does not throw":

- **the transform arithmetic**, before a single file is opened. A chain of the
  nine parts composed in the wrong order is still a rigid transform, and a
  preview frames whatever it is handed — so one mesh on its own looks perfectly
  right while sitting thousands of units from where the file put it;
- every file yields objects and connections — a silently empty tree is the
  failure mode that looks like success;
- in text files, every array is exactly as long as the file says it is, which
  is how a subtly wrong mesh is caught before it is ever drawn;
- **every skinned mesh deforms to nothing at its own bind pose.** Six orderings
  of the skinning matrices look plausible and one is right; this is what tells
  them apart. It is what caught an extra inverse that would have bent every
  model whose bones are not at the origin — on some files only, and always
  plausibly.

A file whose mesh has been moved since it was bound fails that last check
honestly: there the departure measures the file, not the arithmetic, and it is
reported as such rather than hidden.
