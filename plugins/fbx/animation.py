"""Skins and clips: what moves, and where it is at each moment.

This is the part of FBX that everyone gets wrong, so it is written to be
checkable rather than clever. The whole of it rests on one identity:

    at the bind pose, every skinning matrix is the identity

which is asserted directly, on real files, in ``selftest.py``. If the order of
a multiplication is wrong — and there are six ways to get it wrong — that
assertion fails, instead of an arm bending the wrong way on the third file in
fifty and nobody noticing.

Why the matrices come out that simple is worth writing down, and so is the
thing that is *not* what the documentation says.

A cluster carries two matrices. ``TransformLink`` is the bone's global
transform at bind time — that one is as advertised. ``Transform`` is widely
described as the mesh's global transform at bind time, **and it is not**: it is
the mesh's bind transform expressed *in the bone's space*, so ``T · L`` is the
mesh's global transform and ``L⁻¹`` is already folded into it. Measured across
every skinned mesh in the corpus, ``T · L = M`` holds to machine precision
while ``T = M`` is out by tens of units. Undoing ``L`` a second time — which is
what the documented formula reads like — bends everything about a bone that is
not at the origin, and only on files whose bones are not at the origin.

So, with a vertex already in world space (placed by its mesh transform ``M``
and the axis fix ``F``):

    p_world_now = p_local · T · B(t) · F,   p_local = p_world · F⁻¹ · M⁻¹

    skin(t) = F⁻¹ · M⁻¹ · T · B(t) · F

At the bind pose ``B = L``, and since ``T · L = M`` the whole thing collapses
to the identity. That is the check the self-test runs, and it is what caught
the extra ``L⁻¹``.

    asked, none of them played at all — the baking walked clusters, and a mesh
