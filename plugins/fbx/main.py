"""FBX — looking inside Autodesk's interchange format.

Step 0: what is in this file. F3 on a `.fbx` answers with its meshes, its
skeleton, its clips and how long they run, before any of it is drawn.

That is worth having on its own — half of what anyone wants from a folder of
assets is "which of these is the animated one" — and it is also the floor the
rest is built on: the same parser and the same object graph feed the model
viewer that comes next.
