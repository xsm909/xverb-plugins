"""Wavefront OBJ, and the `.mtl` beside it.

The oldest and simplest of them: one line per thing, in text. No animation, no
skeleton, no hierarchy — a bag of polygons with names on it. What it does have
and what has to be right:

- **indices count from one, and may be negative**, meaning "so many back from
  here". A file that uses the negative form and a reader that does not is off by
  the whole model.
- **a face corner is `v/vt/vn`** with either of the last two missing, so
  `1//2` is a corner with a normal and no picture coordinate.
- **faces may have any number of corners**, and are fanned like FBX's.
- **`usemtl` cuts the mesh**, exactly as a material slot does in the other two
  formats, so one file arrives as several meshes.
- the picture coordinates run **up** from the bottom, as FBX's do, so they are
  turned over here.
