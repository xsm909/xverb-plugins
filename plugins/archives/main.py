"""Archives as folders: walk into one, copy out of it, pack into it.

**ZIP and tar in one plugin**, because they differ by a codec and share
everything else — the URL, the walk, the F3 table, the refusal to write an
archive that is not on this machine. Two plugins would be two copies of that
machinery in two processes, since one plugin cannot import another. What each
format *does* differ by lives in :mod:`zipbox` and :mod:`tarbox`, and the two are
not alike: a ZIP has a directory at the end and a tar has nothing, so a tarball
is listed by walking it and a compressed one cannot be appended to at all.

**What this is not.** It is not a pack command, an unpack command, a progress
window or a queue. An archive here is a *file system*, and everything the panels
already know how to do with a file system therefore works on it: Enter walks in,
F5 copies out, F5 the other way packs, F3 views a file inside one, the search
finds things in it, and the disk map will measure it. The application's own copy
carries all of that, with its progress, its collision dialog and its cancel, and
none of it is written twice here.

**Reading goes through the host, writing does not.** Bytes are read with
``plugin.read_file``, which resolves whatever transport the archive is on — so an
archive sitting on an FTP server opens exactly like one on the disk, and the
plugin never learns the difference. Writing has no such road: the host serves
reads to plugins and not writes, so an archive can only be *changed* where the
platform can open it, which means on this machine. Anywhere else says so plainly
rather than half working.

**Nothing written is held open.** Every write closes the archive when the file
ends. Reading holds more: the archive while the panel is in it, and a member
being copied out while the copy is reading it, so that each 256 KB piece
carries on from the last instead of decompressing the member from its start
again. An archive with no central
directory at the end of it is not an archive, and the way to get one is to hold
it open across an application that then stops.
