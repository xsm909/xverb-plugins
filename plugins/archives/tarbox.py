"""Everything here knows what a tar is. It is a different animal from a ZIP.

A ZIP has a directory at the end saying where everything is. **A tar has
nothing.** It is a stream of headers each followed by its bytes, and the only
way to know what is in one is to read all of it — and if it is compressed, to
decompress all of it. Three things follow, and they shape the whole file:

* **Listing costs a walk.** :mod:`tarfile` does it once and remembers the
  offsets, so the archive is kept open and the walk is paid for once per
  archive rather than once per keystroke.
* **A member's size goes in front of its bytes.** There is nowhere to put it
  afterwards, so a member arriving in chunks is written to a file of its own
  first and added when its real size is known. Which also means a copy that is
  cancelled has touched nothing.
* **A compressed tarball cannot be appended to at all.** `tarfile` says so in
  as many words: mode ``"a"`` is uncompressed only. Adding a file means writing
  the archive again, so members are staged in a plain tar beside it and the
  archive is written once, when the host says the operation has finished.

The one thing tar does better: it stores what a file *was* — the mode, the
owner, and a symbolic link as a link rather than as a copy of what it points at.
