"""Everything here knows what a ZIP is. Nothing else in the plugin does.

The format itself is :mod:`zipfile`'s business — it has read ZIPs for thirty
years, it handles zip64, the data descriptor and the encryption, and a hand
written parser would only be a worse one. What is left is the part a library
cannot decide for you:

* **What a member is called.** The spec says names are in code page 437 unless
  a flag says UTF-8, and the archivers that shipped in Russia wrote code page
  866 while Windows tools wrote 1251. Getting this wrong is not a cosmetic
  matter: it decides whether a file can be found again.
* **What is a folder.** A ZIP has no directories, only names with slashes in
  them, and some archivers store an entry per folder while others do not.
* **What has to be rewritten.** Deleting from a ZIP means writing a new one,
  because the central directory is at the end and an entry cannot be taken out
  of the middle.
* **What must be refused.** A member called ``../../etc/passwd`` is not a file
  in the archive, it is an attempt to write outside wherever it is unpacked.
